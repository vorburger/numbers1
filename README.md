========

This is a numbers learning game (or, rather, a starting point for one; oh well.) Try it out at https://rawgithub.com/vorburger/numbers1/master/app/index.html (simpler alternative to GitHub pages) !

My very first real JS "App", ever.. toyed a bit with Yeoman etc.  Made during new year holidays, as 2013 resolution to freshen up on my rusty JS.. ;) Basically it started out as wanted to convert the simple http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/vorburger/3127653 project I made with kids from MIT Scratch to JS..
